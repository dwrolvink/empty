# noteA   
## Test of this page   
This page has a link to noteC, which is in a different folder, and different folderdepth relative to the root, than this note.   
   
This page also has an inclusion of noteB, which is in a different folder, and different folderdepth relative to the root, than this note, and noteC.   
   
noteB has a link to noteC.    
   
This results in two links on this page, which both need to point to the same location.   
   
Both notes also include a small picture, the same reasoning follows for that.
